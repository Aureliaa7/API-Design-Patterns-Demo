* Action filters in .NET: https://code-maze.com/action-filters-aspnetcore/
* ASP.NET Core HttpActionResults extension methods: https://github.com/ivaylokenov/AspNetCore.Mvc.HttpActionResults

Gave up on ASP.NET Core HttpActionResults package because there were some conflicts between this package and 
Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc and created a custom PreconditionFailedResult (which does not exist in Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc).
